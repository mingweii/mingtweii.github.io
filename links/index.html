				<dd> It is a very good program for any physics undergrads, graduate students or postdocs who are
					interested in a career in the industry. You can match with several mentors who are established industrial physicists.
					It is also a great networking platform. Many of the mentors on the APS Impact program are willing to discuss
					 with you about the career navigation questions and sometimes even generously help you with the job
					  application processes and share their tips.
