	<h2> Quantum Computing Software and Hardware:</h2>
	<li>
		<a href="https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html" target="_blank">Qiskit Textbook</a>
		<dd> It is very detailed and up-to-date tutorials about learning quantum computation with Qiskit. What most
			fascinates me about Qiskit is that it also demonstrates how to low-level control and calibrate the real
			qubits and gate operations remotely with microwave pulses with <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.06755"
				target="_blank">Qiskit Pulse </a>.

		<a href="https://qiskit.org/metal/" target="_blank">Qiskit Metal</a>
		<dd>
			A recently released software to automate the design and simulation of superconducting qubits, integrated
			with several microwave simulation softwares, such as HFSS and Sonnet. It is exciting that this life-saving
			software is also open to the public.

	<h2> Career Navigation for Early-Career Physicists:</h2>
	<li>
		<a href="http://impact.aps.org/" target="_blank">APS Impact Program: Industry Mentoring for Physicists</a>
		<dd> It is a very good program for any physics students or postdocs who are considering a career in the
			industry. You can match with several mentors who are established industry physicists. It is also a great
			networking platform. Many of the mentors on the APS Impact program are willing to discuss with you about the
			career navigation questions and sometimes even generously help you with the job application processes and
			share their tips.
