<h2> Early Career as an Electrical Engineer with Love in Physics </h2>

<h3>Childhood</h3>
<p>I was born and grown up in Taiwan. I spent my childhood (grades 1 to 12) at the National Experimental High School (NEHS) in Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan,
where I met many of my friends, who share the similar passions for questing the nature of the universe,
love building things, and grow up in families of scientists and engineers. This environment cultivated me
and kept fueling me to chase a dream of becoming a scientist. </p>
<h3>Undergraduate</h3>
 <p> In 2006, I went to the <a href="https://eecshp.nctu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction" target="_blank">
   Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Undergraduate Honors Program (EECSHP)</a> in National
Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan. This multidisciplinary program gave me much flexibility in taking courses in
both engineering and physics. My favorite subjects in undergraduate were quantum mechanics, solid state physics and photonics. I was considering
a research career in quantum optics to study light-matter interactions.</p>
<p> In my senior year, I obtained a chance to go to the University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign for a one-semester exchange program,
where I did the independent study on optical metamaterials under Prof. Shun-Lien Chuang's advise and interacted with Prof. James Eckstein when I took his Electrodynamics course.
This was a great experience for me as the first glance of research and physicist's life in a leading university in the US.</p>
<p>I also did my undergraduate research on the theory of plasmonics in Prof. Chung-Hao Tien's group. With his help, I fortunately acquired
an opportunity to work at AU Optronics for two months as an intern in Summer 2010. There, I gained the first experimental research experience to
implement my knowledge in plasmonics. We hoped to enhance the quantum efficiency of an Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) display by doping
some gold nanoparticles. To achieve the optimized enhancement, I fabricated several OLED devices
by varying the distance from the emitting layer and the doping concentration. Although two months are not enough for me to achieve a robust
improvemnt that can be used in a product, I enjoyed conducting an experiment and achieving some brightness improvements in an industrial setting.</p>
<p> After finishing the internship, I served the mandatory military service in Taiwan for about a year and worked on my graduate school applications.
  In 2011, I worked as an engineer in Qualcomm MEMS Technology, a company developing <<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_modulator_display">Mirasol display</a>, a microelectr


  <p> Before my graduate study at Duke University, I was doing voluntary work in Prof. Chon-Saar Chu's group
