<h2>Career as a Physicist</h2>

<p>From August 2013 to September 2018, I did my PhD study in experimental condensed matter physics at Duke
  University in <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu" target="_blank">Prof. Gleb Finkelstein's Group</a>.
  In my first two years as an infant physicist, I had worked on the fabrication and the measurement of various
  materials and devices, such as chrominm tunnel junctions, silicon germanium nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and
  chemical vapor deposition (CVD) -grown graphene. I also helped assemble a Leiden dilution refrigerator and
  built some electronic instruments for quantum transport measurement such as current amplifiers and an 8-channel
  digital-to-analog converter. These experience helped me grow maturity as an experimental quantum phycisit.</p>
<p>Thanks to the new discovery of supercurrents flowing along the quantum Hall edges in a ballistic graphene
  Josephson junction done by my colleagues, Dr. François Amet and Dr. Chung-Ting Ke <i>et al.</i>, published
  in <i>Science</i> in 2016 [ <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/966" target="_blank"><i>link</i></a> ],
  I was furtunate to enter this new and exciting field and continue investigating the interplay of quantum Hall
  effect and superconductivity by designing and conducting several experiments that are important steps
  toward the future realization of fault-tolerant topological qubits with quantum Hall/superconductor hybrid
  devices. These experiments lead to <a href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/17506" target="_blank">
  my dissertation</a> (read<a href="/Publications/index.html"> here</a> for more details).
</p>

<p>Since September 2018, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/" target="_blank">
  Prof. James Williams' Group</a> at Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland, College Park. My recent
  research focuses on the Josephson effects in tin telluride (SnTe) nanowires. I discovered an unusual symmetry
  breaking Josephson effect, which can be attributed to the frustration between the two-band Josephson couplings
  and the interband Umklapp scattering induced by the ferroelectric distortion in SnTe. Meanwhile, I am also
  developing the shot noise and cross-correlation noise measurement techniques at about 1GHz to probe the
  quasiparticle statistics in topological materials and superconducting devices. The story continues...</p>

    <h3>Undergraduate Studies</h3>
      <p> I attended the <a href="https://eecshp.nctu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction" target="_blank">
        Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Undergraduate Honors Program (EECSHP)</a> at National
        Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2006. This multidisciplinary program gave me much
        flexibility in taking both engineering and physics courses. My favorite undergraduate courses were
        electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, solid state physics and photonics. In fact, I used to consider a
        research career in quantum optics to study light-matter interactions. I also did my undergraduate
        research on the simulation of surface plasmon excitations in a planar structure in
          <a href="https://dop.nctu.edu.tw/en/people_ii.html?tID=56" target="_blank"> Prof. Chung-Hao Tien's group</a>.</p>
      <p> In Fall 2009, I travelled to the University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as an exchange
        student, where I did the independent study on optical metamaterials under the advise of Prof. Shun-Lien
        Chuang and also interacted with a physicist Prof. James Eckstein when I took his Classical electromagnetism
        course. This short but invaluable experience in UIUC inspired me to pursue a research career in the US.</p>

    <h3>Industry Experience</h3>
      <p>At the close of my undergraduate career, thanks to Prof. Tien's recommendation, I worked as an intern at
        <a href="https://www.auo.com/en-global" target="_blank">AU Optronics (AUO)</a> for two months in Summer 2010.
        There, I fabricated and measured several Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) devices doped with gold
        nanoparticles to plasmonically enhance the quantum efficiency of the OLED display. Although two months
        of the internship were not enough for me to implement this into a real product, I achieved some luminescence
        improvements and gained my first experimental research experience in an industry setting.</p>

      <p> After finishing the internship, I served the mandatory military service in Taiwan for 11 months. In 2012,
        I worked as an engineer in Qualcomm MEMS Technology, which was focusing on developing and commercializing a
        new type of displays, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_modulator_display">Interferometric
        modulator display (IMOD)</a>, also called Mirasol display, based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS).
        This reflective display does not require any backlight, which is excellent for e-readers and smartwatches.
        My duty was to test and troubleshoot the failed controller boards of Mirasol displays, manage and maintain
        the electronic instruments. I also designed the schematics of a testing board with OrCAD Capture and FPGA
        for a new generation of Mirasol display. It was a great experience for me to support other senior R&D engineers
        in the team and learn useful techniques from them.</p>
    <h3> Transition to a Physicist career</h3>
      <p> After the working experience in the industry, I decided to pursue a scientific career in condensed matter
        physics in order to broaden and deepen my understanding of the physical world and ultimately engage myself
        in the future development of electronic devices and computing hardware. To get started my physicist career
        before my graduate study, I did voluntary research work in 2013 in
        <a href="https://www.ep.nctu.edu.tw/teacher_members/teacher_member_view_en/29" target="_blank">Prof.
        Chon-Saar Chu's group</a> at the Department of Electrophysics, National Chiao Tung University, focusing
        on analytically verifying the existence of the vacuum induced Berry phase under the rotating wave approximation
        in the Jaynes-Cummings model.</p>

      <h4>Mangas and Sci-Fi</h4>
        <p> I love reading Japanese manga and watching Sci-Fi movies and TV shows to experience imaginary worlds
          beyond our scientific understanding. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece" target="_blank"><i>One Piece</i></a>,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasyte" target="_blank"><i>Parasyte</i></a>, and
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_Formars" target="_blank"><i>Terra Formars</i></a> are
          some of my favorite mangas. And <i>Inception (2010)</i> is one of my favorite Sci-Fi movies.</p>
      <h4>Music</h4>
        <p> I also like various types of music, such as classical, rap, hip-hop and blues. I used to play the
          piano and the viola. I love singing and whistling in my free time. From October 2012 to June 2013, I
          joined the <a href="https://www.tpf.org.tw/family/74" target="_blank">Taipei Philharmonic Chorus</a> as
          a Tenor II. I travelled from Hsinchu to Taipei every Thursday evening to attend a three hour practice
          with the chorus and met several friends with diverse backgrounds. It was also a great memory to sing in
          a chorus with the National Symphony Orchestra on the stage of National Concert Hall in Taiwan for three
          times before for my PhD study.</p>
      <h4>Sport</h4>
        <p> I love playing basketball, swimming, jogging, ice skating, and hiking!</p>
