<h2>Career as a Physicist</h2>


<p> From August 2013, I started my PhD study in experimental condensed matter physics at Duke University
  and join Prof. Gleb Finkelstein's group. In my first two years as an infant physicist,
  I had worked on the fabrication of chrominm tunneling junctions, silicon germanium nanowires, carbon nanotubes,
  and CVD graphene but they did not turn out well. Thanks to the new discovery of
  supercurrents flowing along the quantum Hall edge states in a ballistic graphene Josephson junction done by
  my colleagues, François Amet <i>et al.</i>, which was published in
  <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/966" target="_blank"><i>Science</i></a> in 2016,
  I was furtunate to switch to this new and exciting field and continue investigating the transport mechanisms
   of quantum Hall supercurrents by several approaches. This leads to
  <a href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/17506" target="_blank">my dissertation</a>.
  </p>

  <p>In September 2018, I joined Prof. James Williams' group in Joint Quantum Institute,
  University of Maryland at College Park, as a postdoctoral researcher.</p>
