<h2>Career as a Physicist</h2>

<p> From August 2013 to September 2018, I did my PhD study in experimental condensed matter physics at Duke University
  in <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu" target="_blank">Prof. Gleb Finkelstein's Group</a>.
   In my first two years as an infant physicist, I had worked on the fabrication of chrominm tunneling junctions,
    silicon germanium nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and CVD graphene but they did not turn out well.
    Thanks to the new discovery of supercurrents flowing along the quantum Hall edge states in a ballistic graphene
     Josephson junction done by my colleagues, Dr. François Amet and Dr. Chung-Ting Ke <i>et al.</i> in 2016 (
      in <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/966" target="_blank"><i>link</i></a>),
  I was furtunate to enter this new and exciting field and continue investigating the interplay of quantum Hall
  effect and superconductivity by several approaches, which leads to
  <a href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/17506" target="_blank">my dissertation</a> (See more
  <a href="/Publications/index.html"> here</a>).
  </p>

  <p>Since September 2018, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/" target="_blank">
    Prof. James Williams' Group</a> at Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland at College Park.</p>

  <div class="content">
    <!-- <h3>Childhood</h3>
    <p>I was born and grown up in Taiwan. I spent my childhood (grades 1 to 12) at the National Experimental High School (NEHS) in Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan,
    where I met many of my friends, who share the similar passions for questing the nature of the universe,
    love building things, and grow up in families of scientists and engineers. This environment cultivated me
    and kept fueling me to chase a dream of becoming a scientist. </p>-->
    <h3>Undergraduate</h3>
     <p> I attended the <a href="https://eecshp.nctu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction" target="_blank">
       Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Undergraduate Honors Program (EECSHP)</a> at National
    Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu, Taiwan, in 2006. This multidisciplinary program gave me much
    flexibility in taking both engineering and physics courses. My favorite undergraduate courses were
     electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, solid state physics and photonics. In fact, I used to consider a
     research career in quantum optics to study light-matter interactions.</p>
    <p> In Fall 2009, I travelled to the University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as an exchange student,
      where I did the independent study on optical metamaterials under the advise of Prof. Shun-Lien Chuang
       and also interacted with a physicist Prof. James Eckstein when I took his Classical electromagnetism course.
       This short but invaluable experience in UIUC inspired me to pursue a research career in the US.</p>
    <p>I also did my undergraduate research on the simulation of surface plasmon excitations in a planar structure in
      <a href="https://dop.nctu.edu.tw/en/people_ii.html?tID=56" target="_blank"> Prof. Chung-Hao Tien's group</a>.

    <h3>Industrial Experience</h3>
       <p>At the close of my undergraduate career, thanks to his recommendation, I worked as an intern at
         <a href="https://www.auo.com/en-global" target="_blank">AU Optronics</a> for two months in Summer 2010.
         There, I fabricated and measured several Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) devices doped with gold
         nanoparticles to plasmonically enhance the quantum efficiency of the OLED display. Although two months
         of the internship were not enough for me to implement this into a real product, I achieved some luminescence
         improvements and gained my first experimental research experience in an industrial setting.</p>

    <p> After finishing the internship, I served the mandatory military service in Taiwan for 11 months. In 2012,
      I worked as an engineer in Qualcomm MEMS Technology, a company developing a new type of displays,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_modulator_display">Interferometric modulator display (IMOD)</a>,
      also called Mirasol display, based on microelectromechanical system (MEMS). This reflective display does not
      require any backlight, which is excellent for e-readers and smartwatches. My duty was to test and troubleshoot
       the failed controller boards of Mirasol displays, manage and maintain the electronic instruments.
       I also designed the schematics of a testing board with OrCAD Capture and FPGA for a new generation of Mirasol
       display.</p>
    <h3> Transition to a Physicist career</h3>
      <p> After the working experience in the industry, I decided to pursue a scientific career in condensed matter
         physics in order to broaden and deepen my understanding of the physical world and ultimately engage myself
         in the future development of electronic devices and computing hardware. To get started my physicist career
         before my graduate study, I did voluntary research work in 2013 in <a href="https://www.ep.nctu.edu.tw/teacher_members/teacher_member_view_en/29" target="_blank">
           Prof. Chon-Saar Chu's group</a> at Department of Electrophysics, National Chiao Tung University, focusing
           on verifying the existence of the vacuum induced Berry phase under the rotating wave approximation in
           the Jaynes-Cummings model.</p>

  <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h2>Volunteer Experience</h2></button>
    <div class="content">
      <h3>Mr. Shih's Social Service Scholarship</h3>
        <p> In my junior year (2008 to 2009) in NCTU, I was awarded by Mr. Stan Shih's Social Service Scholarship,
          and served as a voluntary after-class tutor to help children in remote areas or in disadvantaged groups
          with English, math and computer skills for about 320 hours in a year.</p>

      <h3>Taipei Philharmonic Chorus</h3>
        <p> From October 2012 to June 2013, I joined <a href="https://www.tpf.org.tw/family/74" target="_blank">
          Taipei Philharmonic Chorus</a> as a Tenor II. It was a great memory to sing in a chorus with the National
          Symphony Orchestra on the stage of National Concert Hall in Taiwan for three times before for my PhD study.</p
