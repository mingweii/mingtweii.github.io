<h2>My Journeys</h2>
<h3>Career as a Physicist</h3>

<p>From August 2013 to September 2018, I did my PhD study in experimental condensed matter physics at Duke University in
  <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu" target="_blank">Prof. Gleb Finkelstein's Group</a>. In my first two years as an
  infant physicist, I had worked on the fabrication and the measurement of various materials and devices, such as
  chrominm tunnel junctions, silicon germanium nanowires, carbon nanotubes, and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) -grown
  graphene. I also helped assemble a Leiden dilution refrigerator and built some electronic instruments for quantum
  transport measurement such as current amplifiers and an 8-channel digital-to-analog converter. These experience helped
  me grow maturity as an experimental quantum phycisit.
</p>
<p>Thanks to the new discovery of supercurrents flowing along the quantum Hall edges in a ballistic graphene Josephson
  junction done by my colleagues, Dr. François Amet and Dr. Chung-Ting Ke <i>et al.</i>, published in <i>Science</i> in
  2016 [ <a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/352/6288/966" target="_blank"><i>link</i></a> ], I was
  furtunate to enter this new and exciting field and continue investigating the interplay of quantum Hall effect and
  superconductivity by designing and conducting several experiments that are important steps toward the future
  realization of fault-tolerant topological qubits with quantum Hall/superconductor hybrid devices. These experiments
  lead to <a href="https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/handle/10161/17506" target="_blank"> my dissertation</a>.
</p>

<p>Since September 2018, I have been a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/"
    target="_blank"> Prof. James Williams' Group</a> at Joint Quantum Institute, University of Maryland, College Park.
  My recent research focuses on the Josephson effects in tin telluride (SnTe) nanowires. I discovered an unusual
  symmetry breaking Josephson effect, which can be attributed to the frustration between the two-band Josephson
  couplings and the interband Umklapp scattering induced by the ferroelectric distortion in SnTe. Meanwhile, I am also
  developing the shot noise and cross-correlation noise measurement techniques at about 1GHz to probe the quasiparticle
  statistics in topological materials and superconducting devices. The story continues...</p>

  <h3>Early Career as an Electrical Engineer</h3>
</button>
<div class="content">
  <h4>Undergraduate Studies</h4>
  <p> I attended the <a href="https://eecshp.nctu.edu.tw/pages/Introduction" target="_blank"> Electrical Engineering and
      Computer Science Undergraduate Honors Program (EECSHP)</a> at National Chiao Tung University (NCTU), Hsinchu,
    Taiwan, in 2006. This multidisciplinary program gave me much flexibility in taking both engineering and physics
    courses. My favorite undergraduate courses were electromagnetism, quantum mechanics, solid state physics and
    photonics. In fact, I used to consider a research career in quantum optics to study light-matter interactions. I
    also did my undergraduate research on the simulation of surface plasmon excitations in a planar structure in <a
      href="https://dop.nctu.edu.tw/en/people_ii.html?tID=56" target="_blank"> Prof. Chung-Hao Tien's group</a>.
  </p>
  <p> In Fall 2009, I travelled to the University of Illinoise at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) as an exchange student, where
    I did the independent study on optical metamaterials under the advise of Prof. Shun-Lien Chuang and also interacted
    with a physicist Prof. James Eckstein when I took his Classical electromagnetism course. This short but invaluable
    experience in UIUC inspired me to pursue a research career in the US.</p>

  <h4>Industry Experience</h4>
  <p>At the close of my undergraduate career, thanks to Prof. Tien's recommendation, I worked as an intern at <a
      href="https://www.auo.com/en-global" target="_blank">AU Optronics (AUO)</a> for two months in Summer 2010. There,
    I fabricated and measured several Organic Light Emitting Diode (OLED) devices doped with gold nanoparticles to
    plasmonically enhance the quantum efficiency of the OLED display. Although two months of the internship were not
    enough for me to implement this into a real product, I achieved some luminescence improvements and gained my first
    experimental research experience in an industry setting.
  </p>
  <p> After finishing the internship, I served the mandatory military service in Taiwan for 11 months. In 2012, I worked
    as an engineer in Qualcomm MEMS Technology, which was focusing on developing and commercializing a new type of
    displays, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_modulator_display">Interferometric modulator
      display (IMOD)</a>, also called Mirasol display, based on microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). This reflective
    display does not require any backlight, which is excellent for e-readers and smartwatches. My duty was to test and
    troubleshoot the failed controller boards of Mirasol displays, manage and maintain the electronic instruments. I
    also designed the schematics of a testing board with OrCAD Capture and FPGA for a new generation of Mirasol display.
    It was a great experience for me to support other senior R&D engineers in the team and learn useful techniques from
    them.
  </p>
  <h4> Transition to a Physicist career</h4>
  <p> After the working experience in the industry, I decided to pursue a scientific career in condensed matter physics
    in order to broaden and deepen my understanding of the physical world and ultimately engage myself in the future
    development of electronic devices and computing hardware. To get started my physicist career before my graduate
    study, I did voluntary research work in 2013 in <a
      href="https://www.ep.nctu.edu.tw/teacher_members/teacher_member_view_en/29" target="_blank">Prof. Chon-Saar Chu's
      group</a> at the Department of Electrophysics, National Chiao Tung University, focusing on analytically verifying
    the existence of the vacuum induced Berry phase under the rotating wave approximation in the Jaynes-Cummings model.
