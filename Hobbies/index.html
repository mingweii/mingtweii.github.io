        I participated in a quantum computing Hackathon event - <a href="https://qchack.io"
          target="_blank">Quantum Coalition Hack</a> with three other teammates in April 2021. Our work on "Qudit Gate
        Implementation - Using Qiskit Pulse" was selected to present in a live-streamed <i>"Selected Project Demo"</i>
        session. My recorded presentation can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/xMigv-62jeE?t=3117" target="_blank">on
          YouTube</a>, and the final submission can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/mingweii/QCHack2021"
          target="_blank">GitHub link</a>. I was also selected as a <a href="https://qiskit.org/advocates/" target="_blank">
            Qiskit Advocate </a>since August 2021.
           <!--We have kept working on this project since then. The follow-up work about
        implementing qutrit gate operations and benchmarking higher energy transmon states can be found on this <a

      <li><b>Creative Destruction Lab Quantum Bootcamp 2021</b>: I participated in a four-week quantum bootcamp hosted by CDL 
        in August 2021, in which I collaborated with several teammates with diverse background on solving technical problems 
        and presenting business applications in four weekly 
        <a href="https://github.com/CDL-Quantum/CohortProject_2021" target="_blank">Cohort Projects</a>. 
        The topics include realizing Google's quantum supremacy experiment with trapped ions,
        solving the unit-disk maximum independent set (UD-MIS) problem with classical and quantum annealers, 
        solving quantum chemistry problems with variational quantum eigensolvers, and implementing quantum 
        natural language processing with Oxford Quantum Group's <code>discopy</code> (my team won the second
         place in this project, see 
         <a href="https://github.com/edenian/CohortProject_2021/tree/week4/Week4_NLP" target="_blank"> here</a>
          for our presentation). In the final Hackathon, my team implemented quantum sensing
         with Xanadu's Strawberry Fields and won the Xanadu's Challenge prize. Our Hackathon work can be found
