<h2> Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
<p>I am both a hardware engineer and a physicist enthusiastic about innovative technologies and solving technical problems. 
  I am now a senior engineer at Qualcomm in Santa Clara, 
  responsible for developing automated testing programs for production testing of latest Wi-Fi RF/mixed-signal ICs.
</p>
<p> Prior to my new journey in the chip industry, I worked as a postdoc in the academia for 4 years.
  In my childhood, I used to dream about being a scientist. Most of my 9-year-long journey was enjoyable; however,
  to better support my family financially after my son was born, I decided to make a career switch from academia to industry.
</p>
<p>In my 9-year-long academic career as an experimental quantum physicist, 
  I contributed 12 peer-reviewed publications in quantum materials and superconducting devices, developed
  proficient knowledge in solid state physics and quantum physics, and also acquired diverse hands-on skills in 
  superconducting device fabrication, and characterization, dilution refrigeration, low-noise electronics, measurement
  and instrumentation with Python and LabVIEW, 3D CAD mechanical design and prototyping, RF noise measurement,
  electromagnetic simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics and ANSYS HFSS, and data analysis / numerical modeling with Python and MATLAB.
  Although in my current position I only use about 10% of my skills I acquired as a low-temperature condensed matter physicist,
  I found that some mindsets for problem solving and idea realizations I learned from Ph.D. training are still very useful in the industry. 
</p>

<p>Prior to pursuing Ph.D. in physics in the United States, 
  I obtained a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, 
  then worked in the display industry for about a year in Taiwan, 
  performing OLED fabrication development and characterization as an intern at AU Optronics,
  and working on failure analysis on controller boards of a MEMS-based display and PCB schematics design for 
  a multi-board testing platform as an engineer at Qualcomm MEMS Technology.

<h3>In my free time... </h3>
<p>I enjoy every moment with my wife and my son. We love to go hiking or traveling with him. </p>
  <p>I am also interested in learning new technologies such as machine learning, artificial intelligence, quantum computing softwares, and FPGAs. </p>
  <p>Music is also an important part of my life.
  I have a diverse taste in music, such as classical, pop, rap, and hip-hop. I enjoy playing
    viola and piano in my free time. From 2012 to 2013, I was also a tenor of <a
      href="https://www.tpf.org.tw/en/family/301" target="_blank">Taipei Philharmonic Chorus</a> and performed several
    times with the National Symphony Orchestra at the National Concert Hall in Taiwan.</p>
