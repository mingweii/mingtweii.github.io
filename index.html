<h2> Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
<p>I am both a hardware engineer and a physicist enthusiastic about innovative technologies
  and solving important problems. I recently joined Qualcomm Atheros in Santa Clara, CA, USA, 
  as a senior engineer in September 2022.
  My primary responsibility is to develop automated testing for latest Wi-Fi RF ICs.
  I am excited about adapting my experience in experimental physics to my new career in the wireless communication industry.
</p>

<p>Before joining the industry, I was trained as an experimental quantum physicist for nine years 
  at Duke University, University of Maryland, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
  where I had contributed 12 peer-reviewed publications on superconducting quantum devices, developed
  proficient knowledge in solid state physics and quantum physics, and also acquired diverse hands-on skills in 
  superconducting device fabrication and characterization, dilution refrigeration, low-noise electronics, measurement
  and instrumentation with Python and LabVIEW, 3D CAD mechanical design and prototyping, RF noise measurement,
  electromagnetic simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics and ANSYS HFSS, and data analysis / numerical modeling with Python and MATLAB. 
</p>

<p>Prior to my Ph.D. study in physics, I obtained a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, then
  worked in the display industry (AU Optronics and Qualcomm MEMS Technology) for about a year, performing OLED 
  fabrication development and characterization, failure analysis on controller boards, and PCB schematics design for 
  a multi-board testing platform.
