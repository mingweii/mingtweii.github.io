<h2> Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
<p>I'm an experienced quantum physicist enthusiastic about learning and developing innovative technology
   and solving important problems.
</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. degree in Physics from Duke University in <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu/"
    target="_blank">Finkelstein Group</a>. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://pls.llnl.gov/research-and-development/physics/quantum-coherent-device-physics-group"
    target="_blank">Quantum Coherent Device Physics Group</a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 
  </p>


<p>During my Ph.D. and postdoc training in physics, I have thus far contributed to the scientific community with 12 
  peer-reviewed scientific journals on superconducting quantum devices since 2016. In the meanwhile, I developed
  proficient knowledge in quantum electronics and solid state physics, and also acquired diverse expertise in 
  superconducting device fabrication and characterization, dilution refrigeration, low-noise electronics, measurement
  and instrumentation with Python and LabVIEW, 3D CAD design and 3D printing prototyping, RF / microwave noise measurement,
  RF / microwave simulation with COMSOL Multiphysics and HFSS, and data analysis/modeling with Python and MATLAB. 
</p>

<p>Prior to my Ph.D. study in physics, I obtained a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, then
  worked in the display Industry (AU Optronics and Qualcomm MEMS Technology) for about a year, performing OLED 
  fabrication development and characterization, failure analysis on controller boards, and PCB schematics design for 
  the multi-board testing platform.
