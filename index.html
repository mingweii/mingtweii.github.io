<h2> Welcome to Ming's personal website!</h2>
  <p>I am an <i>experimental condensed matter physicist</i> specializing in quantum transport measurements and nanofabrication
    of superconducting devices made of quantum materials. I'm excited about not only exploring novel quantum phenomena but also
    learning the latest developments in quantum computing industry. Feel free to contact me if you want to discuss new projects with me!</p>
  <p>I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in
      <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/" target="_blank">Williams Group</a>
        at the University of Maryland-College Park. My recent research interest focuses on:
        <ul>
          <li> DC/AC/RF transport measurements of unusual Josephson effects in low-dimensional quantum materials,
            such as two-band Josephson effects in ferroelectric SnTe nanowires and 2D ferromagnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub>.</li>
          <li> Developing shot noise and cross-correlation measurement setups at hundreds of MHz to study the quasiparticle
            statistics at the interface of topological phases of matter and superconductors.</li>
        </ul>
  </p>
  <p> I received my Ph.D. degree in Physics from Duke University in
      <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Finkelstein Group</a>, where
      I have extensively studied a variety of transport phenomena in ballistic graphene Josephson junctions:
        <ul>
          <li> Temperature activation in long and short junction regimes, anomalous magnetic diffraction patterns,
            Shapiro steps and multiterminal supercurrent flows. </li>
          <li> Observation of supercurrents and enhanced conductance due to tunneling of chiral Andreev edge
             states in a short constricted channel.</li>
          <li> Manipulation of edge-flowing supercurrents in the quantum Hall regime by top- or side-gating the
            vacuum edges, and also by injecting a normal current in a three-terminal device.</li></ul>
