<h2> Welcome to Ming's personal website!</h2>
<p>I am an <i>experimental condensed matter physicist</i> specializing in quantum transport measurements and
  nanofabrication of superconducting devices made of quantum materials. I'm excited about not only exploring novel
  quantum phenomena but also learning the latest developments in quantum computing industry. Feel free to contact me if
  you want to discuss new projects with me!</p>
<p>I received my Ph.D. degree in Physics from Duke University in <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu/"
  target="_blank">Finkelstein Group</a>, where I have extensively studied a variety of transport phenomena in
ballistic graphene Josephson junctions, especially at high magnetic fields in the integer quantum Hall regime. I am currently working as a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/"
    target="_blank">Williams Group</a> at the University of Maryland-College Park. My recent research interest focuses
  on:
<ul>
  <li> DC/AC/RF transport measurements of unusual Josephson effects in low-dimensional quantum materials, such as
    ferroelectric SnTe nanowires and 2D van der Waals materials like ferromagnets Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub> and
    Cr<sub>2</sub>Ge<sub>2</sub>Te<sub>6</sub>.</li>
  <li> Developing shot noise and cross-correlation measurement setups at hundreds of MHz to study the quasiparticle
    statistics at the interface of topological phases of matter and superconductors.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!-- <p> :
<ul>
  <li> Temperature activation in long and short junction regimes, anomalous magnetic diffraction patterns, Shapiro steps
    and multiterminal supercurrent flows. </li>
  <li> Observation of supercurrents and enhanced conductance due to tunneling of chiral Andreev edge states in a short
    constricted channel.</li>
  <li> Manipulation of edge-flowing supercurrents in the quantum Hall regime by top- or side-gating the vacuum edges,
    and also by injecting a normal current in a three-terminal device.</li>
</ul>

  <li><i><b>Music:</b></i> I like a variety of music, such as classical, pop, rap, and hip-hop. I enjoy playing
    the viola in my free time. I was also a tenor from 2012 to 2013 in the <a

    times with the National Symphony Orchestra at the National Concert Hall in Taiwan.</li>
  <li><i><b>Sport:</b></i> I like jogging, hiking, swimming, ice skating, playing basketball and softball, and doing
    home cardio exercies with my wife in the COVID-19 era!</li>
  <li> <i><b>Sci-Fi manga, movies and TV shows:</b></i> I enjoy experiencing lifes and stories in imaginary universes.
