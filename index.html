<h2> Welcome to my personal website!</h2>
  <p>I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in
      <a href="https://groups.jqi.umd.edu/williams/" target="_blank">Williams Group</a>
        at the University of Maryland-College Park. My recent research interest focuses on:
        <ul>
          <li> DC/AC/RF transport measurements of unusual Josephson effects in low-dimensional quantum materials,
            such as two-band Josephson effects in ferroelectric SnTe nanowires and 2D ferromagnetic Fe<sub>3</sub>GeTe<sub>2</sub>.</li>
          <li> Developing shot noise and cross-correlation measurement setups at hundreds of MHz to study the quasiparticle
            statistics at the interface of topological phases of matter and superconductors.</li>
        </ul>
  </p>
  <p> I received my Ph.D. degree in Physics from Duke University in
      <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu/" target="_blank">Finkelstein Group</a>, where
      I have extensively studied a variety of transport phenomena in ballistic graphene Josephson junctions:
        <ul>
          <li> Temperature activation in long and short junction regimes, anomalous magnetic diffraction patterns,
            Shapiro steps and multiterminal supercurrent flows. </li>
          <li> Observation of supercurrents and enhanced conductance due to tunneling of chiral Andreev edge
             states in a short constricted channel.</li>
          <li> Manipulation of edge-flowing supercurrents in the quantum Hall regime by top- or side-gating the
            vacuum edges, and also by injecting a normal current in a three-terminal device.</li></ul>
