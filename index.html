<h2> Welcome to Ming's personal website!</h2>
<p>I am an <i>experimental quantum physicist</i> specializing in fabricating and measuring superconducting devices
  below 0.05K in dilution refrigerators. I received my Ph.D. degree in Physics from Duke University in <a href="https://nano.phy.duke.edu/"
    target="_blank">Finkelstein Group</a>. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://pls.llnl.gov/research-and-development/physics/quantum-coherent-device-physics-group"
    target="_blank">Quantum Coherent Device Physics Group</a> at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

  <li><i><b>January 2022:</b></i> I will be joining <a href="https://pls.llnl.gov/research-and-development/physics/quantum-coherent-device-physics-group"
    target="_blank">the Quantum Coherent Devices Physics Group</a> at the Lawrence Livermore
  National Laboratory to conduct research on superconducting qubits.</li>
</ul>
   <p> :
<ul>
  <li> Temperature activation in long and short junction regimes, anomalous magnetic diffraction patterns, Shapiro steps
    and multiterminal supercurrent flows. </li>
  <li> Observation of supercurrents and enhanced conductance due to tunneling of chiral Andreev edge states in a short
    constricted channel.</li>
  <li> Manipulation of edge-flowing supercurrents in the quantum Hall regime by top- or side-gating the vacuum edges,
    and also by injecting a normal current in a three-terminal device.</li>
</ul>

        I participated in my first quantum computing Hackathon event - <a href="https://qchack.io"
          target="_blank">Quantum Coalition Hack</a> with three other teammates in April 2021. Our work on "Qudit Gate
        Implementation - Using Qiskit Pulse" was selected to present in a live-streamed <i>"Selected Project Demo"</i>
        session. My recorded presentation can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/xMigv-62jeE?t=3117" target="_blank">on
          YouTube</a>, and the final submission can be found on this <a href="https://github.com/mingweii/QCHack2021"
          target="_blank">GitHub link</a>. We have kept working on this project since then. The follow-up work about
        implementing qutrit gate operations and benchmarking higher energy transmon states can be found on this <a
